### Hello

As you can see this project is in shambles.

The idea was to create a cross-chain bridge for NFTs, built on top of Layer Zero. The final idea would be an interface where the user connects their wallet to the website, is able to view their NFTs, select one of them and select a destination chain for the bridge.

An example of a use case could be sending a gaming NFT from one chain to another to reach a new realm (hum hum DeFi Kingdom).

To do so, we modified the code given on [https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/solidity-examples for the OmniChainToken].

We did manage to send an ERC721 from Fuji to Rinkeby (and the other way around) through Layer Zero, but only from the command line.
When we attempted to implement a UI to use those functionalities all hell broke loose and everything broke.
